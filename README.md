# ARM_processor_on_FPGA
This project was developed as part of the university course Digital Systems and Computer Architecture.
It focuses on designing and implementing a simplified single-cycle ARM processor using VHDL in Xilinx Vivado.
The processor combines a custom datapath and control unit and supports basic ARM instructions such as load, store, arithmetic, logic, shift, and branch operations.
I designed modules like the ALU, Register File, and Control Unit, verified their functionality through simulation and testbenches, and analyzed the final implementation on an FPGA.
Through this project, I gained practical experience in digital circuit design, hardware description languages, and a deeper understanding of how processors execute instructions at the hardware level.
